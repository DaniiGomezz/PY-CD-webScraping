        "Of course, certain aspects of a job are universal. If youâre an engineer, depending on your specialisation, youâll be designing databases, developing clients, churning out code and tinkering with curly brackets. Thatâs just as true for Supercell as it is for other places.",
        "What makes work at Supercell stand out is that whatever role youâve been hired for, youâre in those shoes because...",
        "What we mean by applying your craft is probably self-explanatory, but what do we mean when we say weâre looking for cooperative types? In practical terms, weâre saying that your teamâs goals take precedence over personal agendas, that youâre never too proud to ask questions, and that you appreciate the importance of helping others. Being friendly is essential, and an earnest respect for your team-mates and colleagues is indispensable.",
        "Supercellians donât count years of tenure at the company when they choose who they listen to. Youâre trusted from day one to be a fully formed voice within your team and the company, contributing towards everyoneâs success.",

        "You wonât be expected to conform to any corporate structures or layers, and you wonât find any red tape even if you walk all the way down the office corridor. Having rigid formalities in place would make for a slightly more predictable organisation, but we optimise for speed. To that end, thereâs nothing like giving employees ownership over their work and the tools to operate with independence and speed.",
        "A graphics engineer describes his early days at Supercell after joining the Tools & Tech team, who support our game development teams with the technology that they need:",
        "When I joined the company, my team had already agreed with the game teams to build a new renderer for our games. I got to see what had been developed up to that point, and I was given the option to either keep it or rewrite it. What was already there looked really good and was a close match with how I would have approached the problem. So I picked it up from there.",
        "This was no small task, because to modify our games for the new renderer, I would have to get a feel for all the different game teams and their characteristic workflows. I started with Hay Day. Supercellâs culture allowed me to collaborate with the Hay Day team directly, with minimal bureaucracy. Both my own team and the Hay Day crew all trusted me to make the necessary decisions to get the job done, and to handle all communications with the relevant parties first-hand. Whenever I needed a hand with something, everyone was always happy to help.",
        "Having shipped the new renderer in Hay Day, I am now navigating the other game teams and making sure their code base works with the new renderer to eventually bring all games onboard. Without the culture that we have, building and implementing the new renderer would have been much more difficult and time consuming.",
        "Read Part II on the next slide",
        "Visitors on our careers page may have noticed that whenever we have an opening for an artist, weâve hardly ever had one for an Art Director . Well, sometimes we have, but weâve used quotation marks around the title: âArt Directorâ. Because that is, and at the same time is not, what we are looking for.",
        "Confused? Read on.",
        "Supercell doesnât really have any junior artists on board, at all. Even the least experienced Supercellian artists will have a few notches in their belt and could easily call themselves âsenior artistsâ. Many are hardened industry veterans, the kind of people who would have been promoted past the daily grind of crafting art in most other companies, and into positions of directorship.",
        "That hierarchical approach does not fit with how Supercellâs artists operate, however. Here, an artistâs experience is a tremendously valuable resource, but itâs not a badge. Everyone who contributes to the artistic output of our company is essentially on an even footing and has an equally strong desire to work hands on.",
        "People have their personal strengths and specialties, but nobody stands above anyone else. For that reason, it would be very misleading of us to give the impression that we are looking for art directors in a conventional sense.",
        "People have their personal strengths and specialties, but nobody stands above anyone else. For that reason, it would be very misleading of us to give the impression that we are looking for art directors in a conventional sense.",
        "These values play in even when we turn to external production partners and freelancers to boost our ever-growing pipeline. One of our marketing artists, who has spent a lot of time with external studios on making animated videos for our games, sums it up like this:",
        "Whenever I, together with fellow artist colleagues from Supercell, visit a studio for the first time, weâre always cordially received by the studio heads, the CEO, the directors and the big-wheel producers. It goes without saying that we appreciate the gesture. Itâs an indication of how committed these partners are to helping us, and we want to show respect for the corporate culture that they have developed for their own purposes. Yet from the start of any of these partnerships, we always need to make sure that our partners understand one thing: that communicating solely with the managers isnât an option for us.",
        "Story continues on next slide",
        "What weâve noticed is that if we donât work directly with the artists themselves â meaning the very people who are doing the work that weâre commissioning from them â we easily end up with results rather different from what we had in mind. This is only natural, because working through layers of management means things, even important things, may get lost in translation. This costs time and money, and can be demoralizing for everyone involved.",
        "Talking to the artists without depending on proxies comes with two additional benefits. First of all, we get a much better understanding of how the studio actually goes about doing its work. With that information, itâs much easier for us to formulate our requests. Besides, we then know where our assistance might be needed, and where our input might only be an unproductive distraction.",
        "Secondly, an open connection between people is crucial for building trust. We want our partners to know who we are, and vice-versa. Sometimes, when weâre working on projects to tight deadlines, thereâs a risk that everyone involved may end up doing an all-nighter to wrap up a project on time.",
        "We want those artists to know that they are doing it with us, as a temporary team of sorts on a collective effort, rather than having them feel that they are doing it just to keep their bosses happy. This shared sense of purpose has an incredible impact on the quality of the output.",
        "The type of relationship described here is just as relevant within Supercell. Whatever youâre working on is not something youâre doing because your boss told you to do it, which is because their boss told them to deliver it. Youâre doing it for and with your team, because you and your colleagues have a mutual dedication to create something you can all be genuinely proud of."

        "However, many years later, we realized that it is not only about having the best individuals/people but having the best teams. A group of great individuals does not automatically make a great team.",
        "The best team is the one with the best people who work extremely well together.",
        "An important part of our original product vision, back in May 2010 when we got started, was the idea of building cross platform gaming services â games that you could log into and play from any device. But later on, our thinking changed completely. If you continue reading, youâll see why. In short, today we believe that the best quality can only be achieved by focusing on one platform at a time.",
        "Our initial funding came from the founders investing their savings into the company. On top of that, we borrowed as much money as we could from Tekes, the Finnish governmentâs technology funding arm.",
        "Our first office was in Niittykumpu in Espoo, Finland. It was pretty far from Silicon Valley, but we had everything we needed: one 30-square-meter room, six desks we got from a recycling center, and of course a coffee maker. A bit later on, when we started to hire more people, we managed to fit 15 people to that little room. At some point there was no room for our CEO Ilkka anymore, so he had to move out.",
        "Our first game was calledGunshine.net. It was a real-time massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Remember, our original vision was to create cross-platform gaming services, so the idea was that one day players would be able to enter the world ofGunshinevia desktop web, Facebook, tablet and mobile. That said, we had to start from somewhere, and the most logical place was the platform with the widest reach. And at that time, that platform was desktop web and Facebook, so we started to build the game on top of Flash technology.",
        "We managed to launch the private beta version ofGunshinein February 2011, and the open beta launched a few months later. We also started to plan a mobile/tablet version of the game. At its peak in the summer of 2011,Gunshinehad around half a million monthly players.",

        "When we started planning a mobile version ofGunshine, it quickly became clear that the experience wouldnât be great on the mobile platform. It was too hard to try to replicate the mouse/keyboard experience on touch screens. Also, we realized people play differently on desktop than they do on mobile. Mobile games have to be fun even if you only have a few minutes to play.Gunshinewasnât.",
        "It also became clear that our problem wasnât just withGunshine. We had a big problem with our product strategy, too.",

We started to call it âthe ultimate games platformâ. And we started to understand just how different this platform truly was; if we really wanted to create the best possible games for this platform we could focus on nothing else.",
        "To make matters even more complicated, we had already begun developing the next wave of games, which were still aligned with our original cross-platform strategy.",
        "The time had come to make some hard decisions. We decided to kill all ongoing productions for web and Facebook and bet the entire company on a strategy that we started to call âtablet firstâ. We started by perfecting the game for iPad. We would modify it later for smartphones. As time passed, we shifted our strategy to âmobile firstâ as smartphones have grown and it became increasingly difficult to distinguish them from tablets. Today itâs clear that this was the right decision, but in the fall of 2011 it was less obvious.",
        "Probably the hardest decision at the time was killing a game with the codenameMagic. We had a passionate five-member team working on that game day and night for nearly six months straight, and we were all really excited about it. It looked amazing, and it was a game that had never been seen before on Facebook. But in the end we killed it and started to work on something new for tablets. What makes this story a classic is that it was theMagicteam that ultimately developedClash of Clans, which, funnily enough, was also codenamedMagicbefore getting its official name.",
        "By early 2012, we had five small teams working on new games, all for tablets and mobile. We knew that one of those games would have to be at least moderately successful for the company to have a future.",
        "Weâd learned a lot sinceGunshinefailed, and one of the most important lessons was this: Itâs usually better to kill games earlier rather than later. If it starts to feel like the game isnât going to work or isnât fun enough, itâs usually a sign that you should have already killed it. In keeping with this thinking, we killed our first mobile game,Pets vs. Orcs, back in February. And we killed a game codenamedâTowerâlater in the spring.",
        "Another game was a farming game codenamedSoil, which would later be namedHay Day. Our goal was to develop a next generation farming game, specifically designed for touch and mobile from the ground up. There were two things we really wanted to focus on. The first was user interface; we wanted to the most of swipe and other controls specific to touch. The second was social, which lead us to design a real-time trading mechanism where players could buy and sell ingredients amongst themselves.",
        "TheHay Daybeta went live in Canada in May 2012. Until this point, every single beta launch weâd had as a company had been lukewarm at best and had eventually led us to kill the game later on. A few of them had garnered some initial interest, but player engagement soon started to wane. ButHay Daywas different. The engagement was crazy from day one, and it just kept growing. Slowly we started to realize that perhaps, finally, we were onto something.",
        "The game launched globally on June 21st. Everyone who worked at Supercell at that time will definitely remember this exact date because it happened to be Midsummerâs Eve, one of the biggest public celebrations in Finland. We had almost no player support at that time, simply because we never even imagined weâd have that kind of success. So practically everyone who worked at Supercell was online at their summer cottages answering player support tickets while enjoying the beautiful Midsummer celebrations. After that, we decided to stay away from launching major games on Midsummerâs Eve or other national holidays :)",
        "Just before the start of summer vacations in Finland in July we released another new game to beta in Canada. Its codename was...Magic; a codename that later gave the nameClash of Clans, as you know. Many of us were fans of real-time strategy games and had played them online and on other platforms. WithMagic, our original goal was make this type of game play accessible to the widest possible audience. And we wanted to use some of the unique characteristics of the touch interface to create a very special gaming experience on tablets. We also wanted to make the game as social as possible.",
        "Clash of Clanslaunched globally in August 2012. People often ask us if there was a specific moment when we realized we had two hits on our hands. The truth is there wasnât. BothClashandHay Daygrew steadily from day one. It tookClashthree months from launch to become the #1 top grossing game in the U.S.",
        "The fifth game weâd been working on was calledBattle Buddies, a player vs. player tactical shooting game inspired by games such asUFO: Enemy Unknown. Unfortunately, the game never garnered enough player interest to move out of beta, so we had to kill it too.",
        "Since these early days, weâve killed countless games at various stages of development. Usually they get killed after a milestone we call a âcompany playableâ, which means that the team releases the game for everyone in the company to play. In addition toClash,Hay DayandBoom Beach, the only two games that have managed to proceed to beta and launch globally areClash RoyaleandBrawl Stars. It really never ceases to amaze us how incredibly difficult it is to design new games. You would think it would get easier over time, especially when youâve been lucky enough to put out hits like we have. But to be totally honest, it isnât any easier today than it was when we were just getting started.",
        "Weâd like to think that every failure is a unique opportunity to learn, and every lesson will ultimately make us better at what we do. Thatâs why we have a tradition of celebrating these lessons by drinking champagne every time we screw up. For us, itâs clear that releasing hit games means having to take big risks. And by definition, taking those risks means that youâll fail more often than youâll succeed. So whenever we realize that we havenât failed in a while, itâs a sign that we havenât taken enough risks. And that is truly the biggest possible risk for a creative company like ours.",
        "Of course, taking risks isnât only limited to creating games. We have some very ambitious ideas about how games can be marketed to the global populations of more than a billion gamers on mobile today. We want to find exciting new ways to tell everyone on the planet about our games. At some point we realized that for the first time in the history of gaming itâs now possible to create a truly global games company. A company that not only has hit games in western markets but also in the big eastern markets like Japan, Korea and China. To this end, weâve opened offices in Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai, and weâve been pleasantly surprised at how warmly our games have been received there.",
        "Many things have changed at Supercell along the way. But the core beliefs upon which we founded the company are stronger than ever. We still believe in the power of extremely small and independent teams of passionate people. We fundamentally believe in the power of âsmallâ. Being small means you need less management and fewer processes, both of which just make it more fun to work. As such, our explicit goal is to keep the company as small as possible. Today, thereâs 340 of us working across our four offices. Whatâs cool though is that these people come from over 30 different countries, which helps us build a truly multicultural and global environment.",
        "We didnât create this company to make money. But the fact is weâve been lucky enough that our financial success has given us a unique opportunity to think very long term, be very patient, take big risks and do things that most people havenât done before. To us, it still feels like very early days, both for Supercell as a company and mobile gaming as an industry. Our dream is to create games that people will remember and hopefully even play for decades. And we want to build a company that will last for decades. A company whose employees will think itâs the best place theyâve ever worked. And, finally, a company that not only does good for its players, employees and shareholders, but also for the greater community around it. Weâve been so incredibly fortunate, and thatâs allowed us to help others around us.",
        "What all of the above requires is time and patience. Itâs been an exciting beginning for our company. But the reality is that this is just the beginning. There is so much more we can do. We can make our existing games much better. We can make new games that will change how people think about mobile gaming and games in general. And more than anything, we can create a different kind of a company â the company weâve always dreamed of.",
        "Supercell stands out in the gaming industry not just for the genre-defining, high-quality games and repeated success but also for the unique cell structure and culture of empowerment and autonomy. From my experience, both outside and now inside the company, this environment is clearly different from other companies I've been part of.",
        "I have personal failures on that front, when my past new game teams fell apart. Sometimes itâs really those small interpersonal connections that create the biggest problems. My hope is that we frontload all those learnings from the past on why teams failed. Hopefully this way we can strengthen the creative core of a team and say: this team is really strong enough because theyâve gone through shit together.",

There are a raft of other training and online resources for staff who want to learn more in a less public way as well.",
        "\"In my experience, whenever you change some design fundamentals, the whole game needs to be built in a different way. I donât think many players will notice these differences, but they can have a big impact on how the game needs to be built.â",
        "Our threshold for releasing anything to beta should be low, but our bar for releasing anything globally should be high. But one way to fail as a company would be you paralyze yourself. Nothing is ever good enough and you donât put anything out. One thing we fundamentally believe in is that how we ultimately achieve the best quality is we learn as quickly as possible. If you never ship anything to real players, you never learn, and you never achieve ultimate quality.",
        "There is no greenlight process from management, no milestone meetings where teams need to justify their projectâs existence to finance. Teams can kill their games and move on if deemed necessary. All creative decisions are up to the teams. So the role of management in an upside structure?

        "Various minor bug fixes and improvements",
        "2.7M Ratings",
        "Colourful chaos awaits in our 2016 iPhone Game of the Year. Supercellâs awesome card battler delivers excellent deck-building mechanics and fast-paced fights in a package thatâs easy to understand and undeniably fun. Upgrading, unlocking and experimenting with cards gives the game endless replayability, and deciding just where to drop your heroes makes each battle distinct. But no matter how good your deck is, thereâs no substitute for skill and quick thinking.",
        "Iâve played this game for a while, and Iâve enjoyed it, but there are a few things I feel should be addressed. First off, remove or nerf electro giant. It has exactly two good counters, and they only counter it with perfect placement. Some cards are ok at countering it (like pekka) but they still let it get a ton of damage on the tower. Second, I know this is how supercell makes money, but there are way too many people who blow their life savings on the game. It gives them a ridiculously unfair advantage. This is tied hand in hand with people having overleveled cards - a king level 10 doesnât deserve to have three max level cards, especially if all his other cards are level 9 or 10. Aside from these issues, the game is very engaging, and it gives you an opportunity to earn rewards if you play just a few games per day. Itâs a perfect game to play if you have a short break - for example, switching between classes. It always gives you something to strive for, and supercell adds new cards occasionally, which completely changes the strategy of the game. Whenever a new card is added, I generally try to use it in a deck to see what it works well with, and if I like it, I keep the new deck. Your strategy always changes based on what cards you and your opponent are using, and I like that. Overall, itâs a great game that doesnât take too much time out of your schedule - well done, supercell.",
        "I have played this game on/off since three days after its release. Some versions have been 5/5 stars whereas others have been 2/5 stars. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money. The matchmaking is based upon a multitude of factors such as how close you are to a new arena, what your deck is, your card levels, or if you spend money. It is clear that you are supposed to get a couple wins and lose a couple times over and over until you have played many matches and your net trophies are only a couple wins worth. You will never go to the next arena in one try. You will sit 100 trophies below it for a very long time until the game randomly decides to let you progress. It will let you progress only if you purchase something or have tried enough to push past the next couple trophies. There is evidence of this in many articles online. It is unfortunate that most games have become focused on your wallets rather than your enjoyment. As with all supercell games, they are âfree to playâ. However, it takes a decade to reach maximum level for anything in any of their games without spending at least $100USD. It is scary to think the price for maximizing your levels for all cards is likely in the $10,000USD+ range.Super predatory tactics that are becoming more and more imposing on the state of the game each update.I am just simply so upset at how Supercell has taken a great game, perfectly optimized for mobile, and destroyed it.",

Today, we made the decision to end the development of Clash Mini, which was a good game but not the game that would ultimately fulfill our dream.",

Namely, in the last few updates, we have seen peak interest from both our Creator Program and our Community on Reddit and Discord to provide constructive feedback as to how the game could be improved, and we have spent a lot of time trying to fit all of it into the game. We also created incredible content with all of you, from very fun Creator-made Mini Minutes to Stage Channels on Discord and incredibly creative Mini Mondays that highlighted your true love for the game. And for that, we could not be more thankful! It was a blast working alongside you, the community that cared so much about seeing our Mini game grow up.",

Would they think that our culture, that we all are so proud of, was about to change for the worse? But I guess more than anything, I really felt for our people. I was about to challenge them, and ask a lot from them.",
        "The presentation first highlighted the cold facts of Supercellâs performance in the last several years. We had not been able to grow our live games and had fallen behind the best companies who had done so. Furthermore, we had not released a new game since Brawl Stars in 2018. The result, I showed in detail, was Supercell falling from the #1-ranked global publisher of mobile games in 2016 to outside the Top 10 in 2023. It was painful, but honest and necessary, so that we all shared the same context. Next, I walked everyone through multiple significant changes which we believed would help Supercell improve and to close the widening gap between us and the very top-performing companies in our industry.",
        "I would like to share those changes with you in this post, but letâs first rewind to how we came to these decisions. Something absolutely had to change, but what? How? What were the risks?",
        "In lastyearâs blog post, I outlined Supercellâs two-pronged challenge of growing live games and simultaneously creating new ones. We were struggling with both. I was delighted to get a ton of feedback from inside and outside Supercell.Â I spoke to dozens of people, including founders, investors, artists, incubators, accelerators, and members of academia, to get their input.Â",
        "I was surprised that the vast majority of people spent most of their time warning me about what could go wrong if we started changing things at Supercell. In one way or another, most told me: âdonât do it.â Some implied it, others were quite direct, but the message was clear. I was also surprised that this message was more true of feedback from people outside of Supercell vs. from my colleagues inside. I would have expected the opposite.",
        "To give you an idea, among other things, I received input such as:",
        "âYou guys are the only mobile studio that has created five billion dollar games, donât change what is workingâ",
        "âMore than 200 million monthly players, half a billion in annual profits and youâre not happy??â",
        "âLook at [great game company], they did what youâre planning to do and that was the beginning of the end. All the best people simply left.â",
        "âFocus on live games, and take an M&A approach to acquire new games to your portfolio.â",
        "âYou will destroy what makes you unique, which is your culture.â",
        "Nothing is closer to my heart than the people and culture we have at Supercell, so the idea that I would drive something that would destroy itâ¦well, there are no words to describe how that would feel. Stressful doesnât quite cover it.",
        "At the same time, however, it was impossible to ignore the facts. The best-in-class companies grew their live games, we had not (GGWP: Dream Games, Riot Games, King, Playrix, and others). Several great new games came out and performed extremely well since we launched Brawl Stars, we had not launched any (h/t: Royal Match, Genshin Impact, Monopoly Go, CoD Mobile, and others).",
        "With these stark facts and stressful (but invaluable) input from dozens of smart, experienced people, how could we think about what to do? I reminded myself of some key mental frameworks to help us focus:",
        "Do we focus on the past or the future? Unless we believeSupercellâs best days are ahead of us, we shouldnât be here anymore. We have to focus on the future.",
        "Do we focus on things we can control or those that we cannot? This seems obvious, but it is so easy to imagine some outside force that would destroy our culture. We all own it, so it is up to us to ensure the best parts of it do not change. We have to focus on what we can control.",
        "Do we focus on the many ways something might fail or on the few ways it might succeed? My colleagues often tell me that Iâm an optimist (theyâre usually much more extreme in their descriptions of me!). In my career, I have been very lucky to witness enormous successes. In each of those situations, there have been countless things that could have gone wrong and reasons why teams should have failed. However, in each instance, there was a group of people who believed in why something would work and they committed themselves to make sure it did. We have to focus on how & why we could succeed.",
        "This mental approach gave me the necessary confidence that we were about to do the right (and responsible) thing. We owed it to our players, our community, and to everyone at Supercell, past & present. We had to improve and should not let fear of failure drive our decisions.",
        "",
        "The leading idea behind the planned changes was what I wrote about in myprevious blog post: creating a new game from scratch and running/growing a live game as a service are quite different problems. We needed different solutions for each. We would make changes to how we approach new games and live games, and we would change our leadership team as well.",
        "At some point, I realized that the mental model we could apply to new games was something very close to home. As a serial founder/entrepreneur and as an active investor (within Supercell and on my own), Iâve seen great new innovation from startups. So I started to ask myself: what if we started to think of new game teams as their own startups, within Supercell? What helpful ideas could we apply? Turns out quite a few!",
        "Team of Entrepreneurs:We believe that new game teams have the best chance of success, in part, if they are started by a team of crazy ambitious, resourceful individuals who execute fast, are not afraid to take risks, and make aggressive (sometimes painful/scary) changes quickly. Honestly, we have not been rigorous enough about deciding about starting new game teams at Supercell.Too often we have ended up with teams which have not had all the required skillsets or the team dynamics have not been what they should be when you start a crazy journey like this. Our bar should be as high as it would be for starting a new company. Going forward, we will be much more rigorous and are implementing a dedicated system/process to evaluate potential new game teams on this front.The best part of this to me personally is that Supercellâs principle of greenlighting teams, not ideas will remain truer than ever before. NOTE: We will share exciting news in the near future about how people outside of Supercell can participate in this process and have an opportunity to become founders of one of Supercellâs next new game teams! Stay tuned.",
        "Constraints:These teams of entrepreneurs operate under a well-defined set of constraints, i.e., money raised or ârunway,â which act as a forcing mechanism to get @!#$ done as quickly/efficiently as possible. Bottom line: you better have something great before you run out of money. This one is/was really hard for us! I started this thread feeling strongly that we absolutely need hard constraints (e.g., each new game team gets an agreed-upon budget. If they run out of money, before proving the game with players, the game is dead). Not so simple!So many problems/scenarios to overcome: if a team wants to build a âbig game,â then they arguably need a large budget, negating the feeling of a real constraint early on. OK, but what if we slice a larger budget into smaller parts/milestones (very common)? This leads to a greenlight process, which Iâm honestly VERY allergic to. Many great companies work this way, but learning from my past mistakes (I created a greenlight process at my previous company) I would not like to see a process like this at Supercell. Iâve just seen too many times that game teams end up trying to please the greenlight committee vs. focusing on pleasing players and doing something that is risky and new.Even more importantly, we found in internal discussions, this would lead to our developers feeling like they were no longer independent teams. This would undo the more central tenet of Supercellâs culture. We would have to find another way, and I believe we have our starting point, which relies on trusting that we really have the best possible team of entrepreneurs (see the point above). Also, we will ask our new game teams to commit to key timelines, milestones, and resourcing plans to reach them, and then openly share them with everyone in the company. In other words, we will replace the usual fixed budgets or greenlight processes with the pressure of transparency.While I do not believe for a second that structures or processes would create great games (itâs the people and teams that do!), our âprocessâ going forward will be 1) a systematic approach to forming the best teams, 2) trusting the teams, and 3) forcing the teams to operate in an environment of full transparency. Sounds simple, right? Will that be sufficient? Impossible to know yet, but weâre all committed to trying.",
        "",
        "External Validation:In the startup world, the common wisdom is that you want to get your product in front of real customers as soon as possible to validate the âproduct market fitâ. In a similar fashion, new game teams must put their game in front of players as fast as possible. We have not been best-in-class at this, and our new game teams would benefit from testing their games with players earlier.If player feedback meets/exceeds expectations, great - invest more aggressively. If not, thatâs ok - now the team knows it has to pivot. Either way, itâs a good outcome! Problems arise if/when new game teams wait too long to get player feedback and it feels too hard or too late to change course. Thatâs the worst outcome for everyone.Note: I donât believe you create hit games by asking players what they want, but I do believe you have to show them early and face the reality of their feedback. We will implement this thinking for new game teams at Supercell, encouraging and challenging new game teams to test games with players earlier and asking them to share this plan openly with everyone at the company as per the transparency principle outlined above.",
        "Distraction-Free Environment:Early-stage startups face one set of distractions in the form of everything it takes to start & run a company. New teams within large companies face a different set of distractions, in the form of all the natural processes and ânoiseâ that come from being a part of an organization of hundreds if not thousands of people (Supercell is now 550+ people). We want new game teams at Supercell to avoid both!Being a part of Supercell means new game teams donât need to worry about legal, HR, payroll, taxes, real estate, IT, etc. - everything that it takes to start and run a company. However, we also want new game teams to be able to focus and avoid the distractions of a large organization. That means being able to minimize company-level activities such as recruiting, internal events, selecting internal comms and slack channels, etc. We are either removing elements or making them optional for new game teams.As an extreme example, one new game team decided to move out of our main office into their own little space nearby. We had similar discussions regarding technology. While all 5 of Supercellâs global games were built using our internal proprietary engine/tools, new game teams can choose to use whatever they want in early stages of prototyping and proof of concept. We have new game teams using Unity, Unreal, or other tools to help them move as fast as possible to see if they have created something players love. Again, getting external validation as fast as possible is key.",
        "Our goal here is to make Supercell the best place for the best teams to create the best new games. We want this place to be better than your own startup, which sets a very high bar. But we are doing everything in our control to make that a reality and have a lot going on for us. At Supercell, you donât need to worry about building a company and everything that comes along with it, all you need to worry about is building a great game. I know this is a never-ending effort and we will continue to change and improve in the coming months and years.",
        "Once startups have found the so-called âproduct market fitâ (which in my mind means that theyâve been able to develop something that their customers love), they move on to the next phase which is all about making sure as many customers as possible get to use their product/service, while simultaneously making the product/service better. If startups get to this phase, they become âscaleupsâ. This scaling phase is very different and requires a different type of thinking. I believe the same applies to games and we would benefit from taking in some lessons from the scaleups.",
        "At Supercell, we have found âproduct market fitâ with five different games. These days, 200M+ players play our games every month. Clash of Clans has generated over $10B in revenue in the last decade. With Clash Royale, the World of Clash has generated more than $14B in revenue. Brawl Stars, Hay Day, and Boom Beach are each way more than billion dollar revenue earners. These are enormous businessesâ¦yet we havenât been treating them like they are! Iâve written about this in the past, but at Supercell, we had completely overlooked this aspect of our company. For years, we did not realise the full potential of our great games because we frankly liked our small teams so much. If someone from the outside came to visit the Clash of Clans team some years back, it looked like a prototype team to them!",
        "We are lucky to be in our situation where Supercell teams have created 5 amazing games. The question facing us now (which we have always faced) is how do we make each game even better by adding new content and features, and bringing it to hundreds of millions (or actually billions) of people?Â",
        "The following sounds so obvious looking back that I feel like an idiot writing this (and many have probably called me an idiot on this topic!), but we can do what we do only because of our players and we should do everything in our control to make our games better for them, even if it means our teams should be bigger. Players couldn't care less how big or small our teams are, all they care about is to be able to play a great game. And if it requires a bigger team, then it is our problem to figure out how to make that bigger team work for us.",
        "For many of us, bigger teams were scary in the beginning because they require a bit more structure and process, even âmiddle managementâ which has been a curse word at Supercell for years. But now that we have operated with these new, bigger teams for some time, weâve realised that not all of that is bad. In fact, it can be great. First of all, with bigger teams we can do more for our players which is a great feeling in the first place. Second, if you get the structure right, it actually helps people to focus and be able to do better work.",
        "Supercell has always been about these independent teams that we call cells. Basically, what we did here was to redefine what a live game cell is, and this time we embedded all the critical skillsets (also outside game development) into it. We started to think of them as their own âcompaniesâ, with their own leadership teams and such. These âgame unitsâ have started to grow in size. We are still nowhere near the size of some other game teams in our business which can be 500+ people in size, so we are still talking less than 100 people (so far).Â",
        "We are also experimenting with different ways to organise ourselves within these bigger teams. One of the ideas that we are currently trying is what we call âsub-cellsâ, which is just a new version of our cell model. It is exactly what it sounds like: the large independent game cell with one common mission is split into several sub-cells, all of which contribute to the overall mission of the larger cell.",
        "It is a journey, and we are taking the first steps, but can already see the benefits for our players. Weâve never been able to do as much for them as we wanted, and from here, it will only get better.",
        "Note: Because we are growing our game teams, we have been on a faster hiring pace than ever before. We are also starting to hire in several locations in Europe outside of Helsinki, which is new for us. I appreciate that 2023 and 2024 have been difficult years for video game companies, with a lot of layoffs and even closures. Our open jobs are a drop in the bucket compared to the number of jobs lost, but hopefully, with some other studios, also hiring, we can create some positive momentum in our industry.",
        "Given all the changes, an important question emerged: does this create two very different cultures between New and Live game teams, and will that tear the company apart? My answer is only if we let it happen, and we should not let it happen.",
        "At its core, Supercellâs culture has always been about the idea of independent cells, each cell being responsible for their decisions. That means we have always had different ways of working between the cells. We see this diversity as a feature, not a bug. If everyone at Supercell applies this understanding, then these changes actually serve to double down on the original idea of why we founded Supercell.",
        "That said, we should not kid ourselves. This IS a big change to everyday work. There are more people in the company, you cannot possibly know everyone anymore, there is more structure in the bigger live game units, etc. And there will definitely be big differences in how live game units work compared to new game teams.",
        "Simultaneously, we are VERY aware of the risks of a rapidly growing headcount, and are having constant and active discussions around proactively managing it â we want to be careful to only fill the needs we have, but avoid growing uncontrollably and losing ourselves in the process. True, we have had some gaps that havenât been filled for long. However, we also need to be extremely mindful that it takes time to really onboard and integrate people to Supercell, and our ways of working, while also learning from the new joiners.",
        "But despite all of that, we are still one Supercell, with one culture. As we grow, there might be more ways of working, but ultimately weâre rooted in the same values and ambitions: creating the best games that would entertain as many people as possible and which would last for decades and more.",
        "",
        "As I was thinking about all of this, and having all these discussions, I also recognized that if I really wanted Supercell to change, we needed everyone to take ownership and accountability. That responsibility and setting that example starts with me. Any mistakes and flaws in our thinking were ultimately my mistakes, not anyone elseâs. And if Supercell wanted to become better, it would need to start with me and my team, which is the leadership team.",
        "Returning to my presentation at the offsite last August. I spoke very openly about my feelings and mistakes to everyone at the company. I told them how I had failed as the lead of my team, and also putting together the best possible team in place. At Supercell, when we fail (or succeed), we celebrate the learnings that come out of that with champagne. I am not sure if it was the champagne, but speaking openly about these mistakes actually helped me feel much better. Also, it was incredible to get the support from Supercellians at that moment. It meant the world to me.",
        "Anyway, for this next chapter of Supercell, I wanted to surround myself with people who have seen what we are experiencing right now and have helped companies successfully navigate these challenges before. Thatâs why I started to rebuild the leadership team, and after a loooong search was able to convince Sara (our new Head of Live Games) and Fernanda (our new CMO) to join us. It was not easy to find these two because I needed leaders who not only had been successful at running things at scale, but also people who understood Supercellâs culture and what was great about it. I feel very, very lucky that they have joined us!Â",
        "While I am extremely happy and proud about the new leadership team that we now have here, I want to make something very clear. Supercell has never been, and is not, about the leadership. Not old or new. I have always disliked the tendency of the corporate world to turn CEOs and founders into these hero figures who come in and save the world. I want Supercell to be different. My proudest moments at Supercell have always been the ones where something amazing has happened, and I have had nothing to do with it and in fact have been the last one to hear about it. There have been many, many moments like that in the history of our company and that is what defines the Supercell culture and the magic around it to me.",
        "So Supercell is all about our great people, teams and culture. Not about any single individual or individuals. We succeed or fail depending on how great our teams are and whether we have been able to create a culture where these teams can do their best work. And this is where the leadership team can help: I see it as a force multiplier which, if successful, can make Supercell the place where the best people can do the best work of their careers.",
        "So, weâve now been on this journey for a while. It is a cliche but a journey it really is, and this is just the beginning of it. Some of the changes we have made will prove to be the right ones, others will prove to be wrong ones. But thatâs ok, as long as we learn from them quickly and then change them for the better.Â",
        "I told Supercellians that from now on, we should all start to think change as something that is a constant. Yes, sometimes change can feel uncomfortable. But we need to get comfortable feeling uncomfortable. We should think of change as a positive thing, something we need to do all the time to become better. As long as we change for the better every day, and can do that over a decade or two, with some luck, eventually we will land to a great place.",
        "And of course, weâve got our annual financials, which Finnish law requires us to publish, and which we have shared here for quite some time now with some commentary.",
        "Before I get to the actual results from last year, I want to explain how we think about financial results in general. We see them as something that enables us to do more of what weâre passionate about. We have been lucky to be very profitable for years now, which is important because it enables us to take a very long term view on everything, including keeping the quality bar for our games very high and enabling us to try new risky things.",
        "However, we donât see financial results as the end goal but just means to the end, which is to create better games for our players. The financial results are an important signal, however, as to whether we are doing a good job for our players. If we're not creating content and experiences that players feel are worth paying for, then bluntly put we're not creating good enough content and experiences.Â",
        "It is important to emphasize that we did not expect that none of the changes I described above would have any impact on these results. We are still very much in building mode. If we are successful in this, the results will follow, but it will take some time.",
        "All of that said, here are the financial results:Â",
        "Revenue of â¬1.7bnÂ  (down 4.2% compared to 2022)",
        "EBITDA of â¬580m (down 8.2% compared to 2022)",
        "Corporate taxes of â¬110m paid in FinlandÂ",
        "There are two quite different stories behind these figures. The obvious one is that our games declined during the first half of 2023 as the mobile games market overall has continued to decline. The other one is that for our live games, every quarter last year was better than the one before it, and right now we are on a strong growth trajectory. The most shining example of this is Brawl Stars, which more than tripled its player base since last summer and, as I'm writing this, it in fact was the biggest Supercell game as measured by number of players! The reason is, quite simply, that we have been able to do more for our players in terms of creating new content and features to our games. As I said above, we take a very long term view on the changes I described above, and we are very much in building mode, but that said I have been positively surprised that it is already starting to show in the results.",
        "At the time of writing this, it is already February 2024, and I thought I would close with a few thoughts about this coming year. To summarize my feelings, I cannot recall when was the last time we had started a new year from such a great position as we have this year.Â",
        "First of all, we have bigger and better teams than we have ever had. As a result, we can do more for our players than ever before. It is important to note that most of these bigger teams have been in place only for 1-2 update cycles. So Iâd like to think this is just the beginning, and I am extremely excited to see what these teams will do for our games and players as they become better and better at working together in this new setup.",
        "Second, I am incredibly excited about our new games for this year. Some of you have probably playedClash Mini,Squad Bustersandmo.co, which are all still in development but of which we are very proud of. And there is more coming! But more about them a bit later, hopefully in the not too distant future! :)",
        "Finally, I wanted to thank all of the players, the tens of thousands of content creators who are the backbone of our community, and of course all the Supercellians. I feel very lucky to be surrounded by people like you and have an opportunity to be part of something as unique as what we have here.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Last month, Supercell CEO IIkka Paananen outlined the company's financials and discussed the studio's performance over the past few years. Despite having smash hits under their belt with the likes of Clash of Clans,Paananen shared that overall, they had fallen behindwhile others were able to grow their live games even further. With this in mind, Supercell has set out to make changes to put them back on top.",
        "We spoke withSupercell’s Head of Live Games, Sara Bach, who shares a behind the scenes look at how the Supercell structure is changing and how those changes enable teams to work more efficiently, with positive results already becoming apparent in games such as Brawl Stars.",
        "But what else does the new head of live games at Supercell have on her plate, and how do Supercell intend to tackle future ambitions?",
        "PocketGamer.biz: Can you tell us a little about your role as head of live games at Supercell and why you joined the company?",
        "Sara Bach:In the spring of 2023, I began engaging with Ilkka and the Supercell team, who were at the time exploring ways to grow their famously small teams and get better at operating live games. Our interactions started as an exchange of ideas, as I shared some of my experiences from EA, King & Mojang of growing teams and organisations in gaming. I've always believed in the power of empowered product teams, where each member feels a deep sense of ownership and plays an important role in the games' and business' success. However, achieving this in larger organisations, with numerous stakeholders and specialised departments, can be challenging.",
        "Meeting the Supercell team was truly inspiring. I was struck by their dedication to preserving the core of the company's culture and values while being ready to challenge the status quo and undertake the hard work needed for change. When the opportunity to join Supercell and be part of this journey presented itself, it was simply too compelling to pass up. And here I am.",
        "Now, as head of live games, I oversee the operation and development of Supercell's live games, such as Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Brawl Stars, Hay Day, and Boom Beach. Ilkka made it clear from the start that the overarching responsibility for the portfolio's performance rests with me. The mission was clear - grow our live games! I was ready to take on this challenge as I believed strongly in the company's vision and saw the amazing talent and potential everywhere I looked.",
        "What does the role of head of live games look like on a daily basis? What's your day to day like?",
        "My role is to ensure that each game not only excels as an individual business unit but also contributes to our collective success. In my opinion, our diverse portfolio is one of our key strengths, and it sets us apart from the competition. From Brawl Stars with its younger audience, through the Clash games with a bit older and more male-skewed players to Hay Day, which I play every day with my mom, who is 71 and my daughter, aged 11, there truly is a Supercell game for everyone. While each game provides a unique experience, our achievements are interconnected, mirroring an Olympic team's collective triumph. During my first few months, I have focused on building a supportive group of leads and fostering a culture of shared success. Each game competes in its own \"sport,\" but we aim for greater heights by pooling our strengths. To me, this is a huge differentiator in an industry where mobile game companies seem to double down on one big title or drive a portfolio strategy of many small games with few significant breakthroughs.",
        "My responsibilities are diverse, from ensuring operational excellence and growth in our live games to contributing to Supercell's overarching vision as part of the leadership team. In total, our live games organisation consists of almost 200 people at this point and my time is split between organisational matters, people matters, product learning and strategy, and business performance during any given day. While I am accountable for the overall portfolio performance, I see my job as that of the Olympic team leader. I ensure we have the right contestants in each sport and create the absolute best circumstances around them so they can perform at their best.",
        "You mentioned being impressed by the Supercell team earlier. What does Supercell do differently?",
        "Supercell stands out in the gaming industry not just for the genre-defining, high-quality games and repeated success but also for the unique cell structure and culture of empowerment and autonomy. From my experience, both outside and now inside the company, this environment is clearly different from other companies I've been part of. At Supercell, game teams wield significant agency and ownership over their products. While there are moments when top-down decisions are made, such as setting targets or headcount budgets, the overarching philosophy is trust and empowerment, with a \"Supercell first\" mindset deeply ingrained in our culture. Team members are trusted to make decisions that align with the company's long-term interests - a testament to Supercell's faith in Supercellians.",
        "However, stepping into a leadership role within such a framework has its own set of challenges. Balancing autonomy with alignment requires a different approach here. My role leans heavily on supporting and challenging the general managers and their teams, fostering a relationship based on respect for their autonomy while ensuring we're all aligned with Supercell's broader goals and accountable towards the game-specific goals.",
        "While each game unit has the freedom to structure their teams and ways of working as they see fit, there are certain key positions and rituals we believe are crucial for our common success. Unlike many game companies where functions like marketing, analytics, and community management are clearly centralised and separated from product development, we embed these roles directly within each game unit at Supercell. This approach treats each game team as a standalone entity equipped with everything needed to succeed and pushes all of us to think differently about leadership and collaboration.",
        "You touched on how Supercell operates with a cell structure, with the company adding new layers of management. How does this work?",
        "As Supercell continues to evolve and expand, so does the cell structure, adapting to accommodate the growth of our live game teams. In this evolution, each game unit transforms into a Supercell of its own, comprising several smaller, often more focused cells. This new structure allows us to maintain the autonomy and agility that have been key to our success, even as we introduce more layers of management to support our growth.",
        "Despite the increased complexity, the essence of our approach remains unchanged: fostering independence while ensuring alignment with our overarching goals. Each game unit, or \"Supercell within a Supercell,\" has a clear mission and the autonomy to pursue that mission with speed and ownership.",
        "The introduction of more defined leadership roles within this structure is not meant to diminish the independence of our teams; rather, it should enhance their ability to achieve their missions. Leads serve as the kernel of each Supercell, nurturing the ecosystem and guiding the cells. They focus on aligning the teams around specific missions and sub-goals, fostering an environment where accountability and support go hand in hand. We are genuinely trying to evolve Supercell's cell structure to reflect our commitment to maintaining the agility and entrepreneurial spirit of smaller teams while scaling our operations. By empowering leads to nurture and guide these cells, we ensure that our teams remain dynamic and focused, capable of moving quickly and owning their paths to success within the larger Supercell mission.",
        "This might all sound very idealistic, and I’ll be the first to admit that we’re not doing it perfectly. It’s a journey we have embarked on, and we are continuously evolving and learning how to do better as we go.",
        "Supercell CEO IIkka Paananen recently spoke about the last few years at Supercell and how live games had fallen behind, with no new game released since Brawl Stars and dropping from #1 ranked global publisher of mobile games in 2016 to outside of the top ten in 2023. How do you see Supercell begin to change things back around and get back into one of those top spots?",
        "I think Ilkka outlined it quite well in his blog post last year. We need to get better at creating fun and ambitious new games - at a faster rate - and developing and operating our already beloved live games so that more players want to play them for longer and find value in our offerings. I’ll focus on the second part.",
        "There was already a very solid foundation built on the exceptional talent and dedication of our teams, who possess a deep sense of responsibility towards our players and the business. However, it was apparent that our teams had been operating at the edge of their capacity, focusing on a very limited number of projects due to size constraints, which in turn has made every decision critically important due to the opportunity cost involved and in the end led to all players not being served as well as they should. We simply owed it to our players to do better!",
        "These were not just challenges but significant opportunities for growth - in becoming more data-informed, expanding our capacity to fully realize our games’ visions, and enhancing our overall capabilities for live operations and continuous improvement. Without this, it would have been very hard to ensure that our games continued to be played by as many people as possible for years to come and be remembered forever!",
        "Our games have grown quarter over quarter for the past 12 months, and last month, Supercell was back in the top ten mobile games publisher list. With the risk of sounding overly confident - you could take this as a sign of the direction we are heading in!",
        "As part of that growth Brawl Stars has seen a surge in revenue recently. What sparked this and how have the structural changes at Supercell helped enable this?",
        "Brawl Stars was actually one of the first game teams at Supercell that realised that they needed to scale to meet the demands of the players, given the content and gameplay-heavy nature of the game. The team has a very community and player-centric approach. After a couple of less successful updates in 2022 and early 2023, things started to turn around last summer with the introduction of Starr Drops, which brought renewed excitement to the game. The team's focus on enhancing player retention through engaging events, new modes, a daily calendar, and generous giveaways has significantly improved the game experience from the player's perspective. The team has done an incredible job of systematically improving the game and adding the right elements at the exact right time. I am very impressed with each and every individual involved.",
        "The positive buzz generated by returning players helped propel the game in popularity these past few months, and we have seen a considerable increase in both new and returning players. The well-timed launch of the revamped Brawl Pass, now offered monthly and exclusively through in-app purchases, was a calculated risk that resonated well with players. Honestly, we didn’t know how well this would fly, but it turns out - really well!",
        "Supercell has also been growing its live teams on titles like Clash of Clans. What was the thinking behind that, and roughly how big are they now across your games? Does any of this live ops support also involve outsourcing?",
        "It’s already been mentioned, but the team size started to evidently hold us back from properly serving our players the best we could - and should! For example, when Clash of Clans operated with a mere 15-person team, simultaneously focusing on major updates, enhancing the mid-level player experience, and introducing new gameplay elements was a significant challenge. It was nearly impossible to address technical and design debt, which is crucial for maintaining the game's freshness and engagement, without compromising on the quality or speed of updates. We simply owed it to our games and players to do better.",
        "After recognising the need for change, the Clash of Clans team has grown to approximately 60 people at the moment, encompassing game development, operations, analytics, community management, and integrated marketing. This larger, more diverse team structure has enabled us to concurrently work on exciting new updates and improve the gameplay experience for players in different phases of their player journey. It also allows us to refine our tools and workflows for increased efficiency and host more frequent and varied player events, ensuring the game remains vibrant and engaging in the long run.",
        "Across our live games, while other teams remain smaller than Clash of Clans, we are actively exploring and implementing remote cell setups to increase capacity and agility. This also allows us to experiment with different operational models to find the best fit for each game unit. While we do work with some external partners, our focus remains on maintaining the core Supercell culture and quality within our teams, whether in-house or remote. By carefully integrating external support, we ensure we keep our high standards and provide the best experience for our players.",
        "Honestly, we don’t take growth lightly. We don’t want to be like any other large company but do things in a Supercell way. We constantly talk about what growth means for our culture and try to course-correct whenever we see something going off on a bad tangent.",
        "What's an example of how Supercell is now doing things differently with live ops that it couldn't do before?",
        "Larger teams mean both more capacity and more expertise in things such as live ops, and thanks to this, we have been able to make all of our games more “eventful.” For example, we have been able to host more integrated and engaging events in Clash of Clans, with standout examples being Clashoween, Clashmas, and the Lunar New Year celebrations. These events have been particularly well-received by our community, which tells us we have improved in creating diverse, appealing content that resonates with various player types.",
        "Beyond merely increasing the frequency and variety of our events, our larger, more specialised teams have started building out more sophisticated tools for player segmentation and preference analysis. This enables us to tailor our offerings more precisely, ensuring that every player finds something of value, whether in gameplay, events, or monetisation opportunities. With more people dedicated to refining our strategies around gameplay, offers, and pricing, we can create more compelling, value-driven experiences for our players.",
        "However, while we've made significant strides, we're still catching up to companies that have long invested in these areas. For example, in Brawl Stars, the general manager, Frank [Keienburg], directly manages offers and events within our LiveOps system. This will soon change for the better as we have a live ops manager joining the team, allowing Frank to concentrate more on leading his team, now around 50 people and evolving the product itself.",
        "And how are you keeping up with player expectations? Do you think this has changed regarding the amount of events and content that players want?",
        "Since the launch of Clash of Clans and Hay Day in 2012, player expectations for content and event frequency have increased, that’s for sure. The evolving mobile gaming landscape, with incredibly high competition, has raised the bar for the update cadence and diversity. We embrace this challenge, as we see it as an opportunity to step up and do more and better for our players! By growing our teams, we are able to take more risks in terms of developing both content and features and still be meticulous about putting the best possible experiences in the hands of our players. Our commitment to exceeding player expectations is as strong as ever, even in this more challenging landscape.",

        "Perhaps most interestingly, Paananen and Demirdjian are also now welcoming pitches from external teams who think they have what it takes to get through the Team Lab process. If successful, they can go on to make the next Supercell game.",
        "Paananen also gives us his thoughts on the hurdles games need to clear before they go global, why you need to be a “little bit crazy” to start a new game team and if Supercell could soon expand beyond mobile.",
        "The conversation below has been edited for clarity and length. Readers should note that while the greenlight process is referred to as Team Lab below, the programme will be known as Spark going forwards.",
        "",
        "Paananen:So basically it started last year, we started to think about how to make Supercell an even better environment to create the best new games. And then Stephan and a few others made it almost like a research project.",
        "We spoke to all kinds of people in games, but also outside games, we talked to investors, founders, accelerators, incubators, even some members of academia – all kinds of people.",
        "And when the answers came back, there were two thoughts that I feel have always been at the core of Supercell: it’s all about the team. A fantastic team is the starting point, and that should be the singular focus.",
        "And then the second one is that somehow you need to create an environment around the team where a team can have the biggest possible impact.",
        "And then of course, third – you also need to get a bit lucky, because obviously there are lots of great teams out there that work super hard and are trying to create something new, but it just doesn’t work out. You’re actually more likely to fail than succeed.",
        "So you actually want to have people in the team who actually enjoy this type of thing – you have to be a little bit crazy, I guess, to start to do something that you have to work super hard on, and yet the odds aren’t really on your side. But you have to somehow get this energy, and you have to thrive in that type of environment.",
        "Then we started thinking okay, what does it mean in practice? How do we actually make Supercell better in those two things, and not just better, but ultimately, the best?",
        "And then our thought was to put together Team Lab, which is all about putting together the best possible teams, rather than these teams spinning up organically or on an ad hoc basis. We wanted to get super systematic about this and consolidate and accumulate the knowledge we have about building teams. We have 13 years of history, so let’s make sure we learn from the 13 years.",
        "We set ourselves a goal: we want to be the world’s best at creating these new game teams. I truly believe that one of the core pillars of Supercell culture is this idea that we don’t greenlight ideas, we greenlight teams.",
        "It’s a kind of a cliché, but a great team can make an average idea great. But an average team with a great idea most likely won’t succeed. The more pragmatic point is that when a team starts to build a game, if any game comes out, it’s going to be different than the original idea. So if that’s the case, why would you even bother thinking about the idea, or approving or realigning the idea?",
        "We’re going to focus all of our attention on the team, and put in place an amazing methodology including even having a professional psychologist in the team assessing the team dynamic.",
        "Paananen:That’s exactly where we wanted to see an improvement, we weren’t systematic enough. Everybody has a game idea and lots of people want to create new games. But if the goal is to build the best possible teams, how do they get there?",
        "And by the way, there’s very little process and structure and Supercell – we tend to be quite allergic to it – but this is one place where we felt that we absolutely needed it.",
        "Demirdjian:Since the company is growing now, I felt like we needed to formalise the system behind how new game teams form at Supercell for our new employees, but also the older employees. I’m not sure if we ever had a really clear cut answer for everyone.",
        "We built two core pillars. One was to formalise greenlighting teams, not the ideas. We assembled a greenlight panel that interviews those teams and the chosen leads, because it was important to me that it shouldn’t be one person that is the gatekeeper. It’s more like: if you guys believe in this, and you can convince me, then by all means, go to the greenlight panel and hopefully, you will pass.",
        "Demirdjian:For the first run we selected a really diverse panel and Ilkka was part of it. I was very proud of having experts that we really trusted from all parts of the company. It’s not always the same people that make those decisions, or that you have to convince in those interviews. The aim with the second round is to definitely infuse additional people into the panel.",
        "Demirdjian:We want to infuse, from a cultural point of view, more entrepreneurial thinking. You have to have the right ambition levels, you really aim high, you don’t let yourself be scared or think too small.",
        "Of course we need to also have people that are able to kill their darlings, that are able to make those really difficult decisions – killing your entire game, maybe even having to kill your entire team, even.",
        "You have to also be hungry and you have to be able to work with constraints, so it really takes a specific type of developer. We basically test different team compositions, and together with our performance coaches and psychiatrists, we evaluate if the team going the right direction, can they work in different styles, can they create a vision together?",
        "I have personal failures on that front, when my past new game teams fell apart. Sometimes it’s really those small interpersonal connections that create the biggest problems. My hope is that we frontload all those learnings from the past on why teams failed. Hopefully this way we can strengthen the creative core of a team and say: this team is really strong enough because they’ve gone through shit together.",
        "Through that stress test, they have also really deeply collaborated with each other, they know each other well, they know also how to handle conflict and all the stuff that goes into efficient teams and high performance teams.",
        "Paananen:The core team has to feel like a team of entrepreneurs, as if they are about to build a new company.",
        "Demirdjian:We have completed one test run and yes, as part of the deliverables and the pressure, they have to work on prototypes. But it was important for me that the Team Lab lead should not have a say in what kind of games they’re building in those test runs.",
        "I wanted to approach those prototypes more like a tool to see if this team actually can work together and can create something they feel proud of. But at the same time, can they also deliver based on the deadlines they’ve set up themselves, together with me?",
        "If the team feels they are ready and every team member can tell me ‘I’m willing to fight for every single person in this cell because they make me better’ – and I agree – I put them into the final phase of the programme. That means getting ready for greenlight, and they can work on the next Supercell game.",
        "Paananen:It goes without saying that the bar for releasing new games is different to what it was six years ago. Players’ expectations are higher, and the market is even more competitive. That’s just a fact. We just need to have even better teams.",
        "I would almost say that we are doubling down on what actually makes Supercell Supercell.",
        "Previously these cells were organically formed and were a little bit more ad hoc, and now we actually want to put attention and focus in even forming the cell, because we know a once the cell is formed that cell will go their own way. And then they can obviously kill the game, or release it or do whatever they want with the game.",
        "Paananen:Nothing has really changed from that point of view, our bar continues to be super high. Day 30 retention and long term retention are most important metrics for us.",
        "Of course, we do care about monetization, although we do believe that you can build monetization later on, because if you manage to build something that lots of people love and are super engaged with, we believe that over a long period of time you’ll figure out how to how to monetize that experience. But you need to create something that is so fun that people come back time and time and time again.",
        "Things like organic installs is an important one. We aren’t that dependent on user acquisition – over 80% of our new players come from organic sources and I think it’s probably exactly the opposite for quite a few companies.",
        "Our teams have been able to build these great games that are worth talking about, so therefore they spread virally. That’s an important factor in evaluation as well.",
        "Demirdjian:In a test run that concluded just now in February we actually did greenlight two teams, and we also killed a lot during the Team Lab phase.",
        "We’re quite happy with the results with this initial test and as a result, the decision was made to do another round, which will start after the summer. And this time around, after speaking with Ilkka about this, we want to also open the opportunity to external teams to be part of the journey.",
        "Paananen:There are alot of great people, and great ideas also outside Supercell and we want to make sure we’re tapping into the world’s best talent. We want to welcome people who will come in and even challenge how we do things and what type of games to build.",
        "We’d love to have people who are thinking about games differently and would build something that maybe we wouldn’t build. What we can offer those people is this environment where if you truly want to work with the world’s best, you can be part of it.",
        "We have a very, very thoughtful approach on how we put together these teams. It’s not as simple as putting together the world’s best artists, designer, client engineers and server engineers and magically it will work.",
        "The psychologists we have work with professional sports teams at the highest level. You would be surprised by the similarities in putting together a professional sports team and pulling together a new game.",
        "They spend so much time assessing not just the hard skills, but but the soft skills, and how these people fit together. During the first Team Lab run we killed five teams, and then two teams passed – that gives you also an idea what we’re doing here. And we’re excited about the opportunity to open it up externally.",
        "Paananen:We are starting now mobile first, you know, we’ll see what the future holds. But I’m sure you heard about our North American studio – especially PC will be a bigger and bigger thing. But we’re still a mobile first company and we wanted to stay true to that, at least in this first phase. It might change going forward.",

        "Supercell dodged ‘the great resignation’, but it’s doubling down on staff wellbeing anyway",
        "",
        "‘The great resignation’ has not troubled Supercell, says co-chief people officer Lesley Mansford. And yet the company is still working extra hard to keep its staff happy post-pandemic.",
        "Supercell CEO Ilkka Paananen revealed concerns that some staff had pushed themselves too hardin a blogpost earlier this year, promising to evolve the company’s approach to team sizes.",
        "At GDC this year, Mansford picked up that thread with a talk about questioning and evolving company culture.",
        "“I can say that we have not experienced a great resignation at Supercell,” Mansford tells us after her GDC talk. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean that people aren’t thinking about what’s important to them, and how they want to work. And of course, how often they want to come into the office.”",
        "True to form, Supercell management has not issued any diktats on office or home working. It is down to teams and individuals at Supercell to define their relationship with the office, says Mansford.",
        "“We haven’t made any sort of grandiose claims that everyone has to come in these days or those days,” she says. “I do think personally and philosophically with this company that we’re in the creative business, and I feel like being together matters. But how often we have to be together, I don’t know how often that matters.”",
        "Supercell’s new North American studio – still very much a work in progress – will exemplify this super flexible approach. “If you saw the announcement, it specifically wasn’t announced as a San Francisco studio, it’s a North American studio,” says Mansford.",
        "“Ryan [Wener, NA studio lead] is super open to whatever that might look like. That might be a founding team in Seattle or wherever. Or it might be a founding team that decides how and where they want to work.”",
        "And for those existing Supercell staff – especially the ones that maybe pushed themselves too hard recently – the company has invested further in staff well-being, particularly on mental health.",
        "Staff can ask to be trained like mental health first aiders under a program called ‘Jedis of the mind’, and in Helsinki there’s a psychologist on-site twice a week. There are a raft of other training and online resources for staff who want to learn more in a less public way as well.",
        "“We work with a company who did a whole bunch of training to increase awareness of mental health and also reduce the stigma,” says Mansford. “If people aren’t talking about it, then that’s a problem in itself. I’ve had my own mental health challenges, I burnt out at EA and had to leave, and I got very depressed during COVID. So, you know, myself and others were able to share our own experiences.”",
        "Getting ahead of any issues that might arise is also part of the plan. All Supercell staff can ask for a coach who can work with them on what they want their work-life balance to look like, and how to go about achieving that.",
        "“I think that it’s time for all companies to think more about root causes,” says Mansford. “And to think a little bit more about if, as an organisation or a company or a leadership team, we’re getting in the way. On that team and individual level, are all the important discussions being had?”",
        "Between Paananen’s blog, Mansford’s GDC talk and, well, this interview, Supercell is being very public about moving its working culture forward.",
        "So what’s changed? Supercell teams are already famous for being autonomous and trusted to do what’s best for their games. Increasingly, it seems, that now applies to what’s best for their working lives, too.",

        "In ourMaking Ofseries, PocketGamer.biz reaches out to developers to learn more about the process of releasing a video game and highlight the extensive work that goes unseen in the background.",
        "This week, we spoke withSupercellgame leadTouko Tahkokallioabout how Clash Quest strives to disrupt the match-three-dominated puzzle games genre and the lengthy iteration process behind making games at Supercell.",
        "PocketGamer.biz: Where did the initial idea for Clash Quest come from?",
        "Touko Tahkokallio:Every project at Supercell has had its own unique development journey and the story of Clash Quest is no different. Usually, a new project gets kicked off at Supercell when a small group of people come together and start working on a game or a few prototypes. So typically, first there is a team and after that comes a game.",
        "However, Clash Quest got started more like a side game project that only later evolved into a full game team. In August 2018, I was working as a game lead for Everdale and started thinking how we could combine Clash troops with a new type of puzzle gameplay. My feeling back then was that puzzle games had evolved to a quite specific direction, dominated by only a few core mechanics (mainly match-three or blast mechanics). I felt that there was still much more to be explored in the puzzle space.",
        "I initially wrote a quick design draft of the idea and showed it to some people. A few weeks later I talked with one of our developers, Juho Glad, who had just finished a project and was looking for something new. I showed the concept to him and Juho got excited. We quickly decided to start building a prototype for the game. For the next nine months or so, we iterated the prototype together and tweaked the design. I was still focusing on Everdale and only worked on the design side, whereas Juho was fully working on it, creating everything from art to code.",
        "At some point, after iterating the game enough, we felt it was ready for an actual company wide playable. We let everybody in the company play the game and gathered feedback from it. The playtest got some good feedback and we decided to start building an actual team around the game. We officially kicked off the project in fall 2019. At this point, I jumped into full time working on the game and Lasse Seppänen took the lead of the Everdale team. We ditched the prototype and re-started the project on our own internal engine. After roughly 18 months of development work, with a team that grew from four to 13 people, we finally put it out to beta in April 2021.",
        "What have you enjoyed most about working on Clash Quest?",
        "From the get-go, the goal was to build a new type of puzzle game that would utilise the magic of Clash characters. We wanted to make a puzzle game that would not be a copy of any other game out there. The most fun part of the challenge has been just this - how to create something new that would still be fun and intuitive to play. Not an easy challenge!",
        "Curiously, some people have made the comparison that this game is similar to match-three games, whereas others have said it is similar to Legend of Solgard. While it does share some similarities between both games (say with Solgard in terms of having power progression and a linear map), I think the actual core gameplay mechanics are quite different.",
        "In my experience, whenever you change some design fundamentals, the whole game needs to be built in a different way. I don’t think many players will notice these differences, but they can have a big impact on how the game needs to be built. For example, just the fact that in Clash Quest the match end trigger is running out of troops, instead of say, running out of turns, has a big impact on many things. Not having a clear reference game makes development harder but also provides lots of fun new design challenges for the team.",
        "In addition to iterating the game play, the most fun parts from the design point of view have been coming up with the systems on how to generate and manage the content. For us, all levels are generated based on just some data. This allows us to manage and iterate progression, content, and the economy of the game quite easily and also allows us to keep the team very small.",
        "",
        "The other system I personally really enjoyed designing was the League system for the game. In Clash Quest Leagues, all players around the world are competing in the same League system, with endless content, yet with an equal competitive playing field. Coming up with the systems for how to manage one giant League structure and how to create endless content in a balanced way for all players in different points of progression was really fun!",
        "What has been the biggest challenge or setback you've had to overcome during development?",
        "As always in development, there are many small challenges and setbacks that you need to deal with. I think building the team, maintaining momentum, figuring out the right scope for the beta, and so on were all difficult challenges. I don’t think we faced any one particular major setback during the development though, nor did we do any major pivots.",
        "Figuring out how to communicate the attack outcomes the clearest way to the players has been one of the challenges we have spent a lot of time iterating on. Making the troop behaviour as intuitive as possible and finding ways to teach players how the different troops behave in the game was one of the main challenges for us. For example, the possibility to preview the attacks by tapping and holding was implemented to help players learn how the attacks would play out and therefore help them better strategise their next moves and eventually master the game.",
        "Have there been additional stages in developing a game with an already established IP?",
        "It is an interesting challenge - and a great opportunity at the same time - to use an existing IP for a game. For one, an existing IP provides a lot of interesting building blocks to play around with! For us, the most natural starting point for the game was to use the troops and defences from the Clash world. It is a great benefit to have lots of cool content that many players are already familiar with.",
        "On the other hand, adapting the visual style to fit both the game and the IP was not easy. We tried many different art styles, some more detailed and visually complex, some very casual and simplistic. The final visual style was settled on because we felt it supported the gameplay the best - clear and simple characters are easier to read and interact with on a small puzzle grid.",
        "",
        "What did you learn from the soft launch period, and were there any changes you enacted as a result?",
        "There has been tons of learning for us. We wanted to go to beta with a quite minimalistic and bare-bone version of the game and we ended up cutting out a lot of features that we envisioned being in the game from the initial beta release. The idea was that we could test out the core gameplay with real users as fast as possible and see if it had promise or not. During the beta, we have implemented a lot of these \"missing features\", such as Clans and the Clan League, which we added in our big November update last year.",
        "I think one of the learnings for us has been to understand what type of players our current core users are. Currently, they seem to be quite strategic players, who understand the depth in our game and enjoy \"brainy\" puzzles. While many players do enjoy this strategic planning, some people won’t get this far and instead quit early. We think they too often feel like they didn’t make any meaningful progress and hit a difficulty wall they can’t pass. We think, at its current form, some players see the game too hard and perhaps also too deterministic.",
        "In our next update, we want to provide players with more cool action moments, while also adding some more depth to the gameplay. We are hoping to address this by introducing a new set of collectables: runes. Troops can now equip runes, providing powerful but rare effects that can affect the outcomes of the battle in cool and surprising ways.",
        "What will be your approach to live ops once the game is released?",
        "Our plan is to make the game world feel more alive and to provide more variety and depth to the game over time. In the future we are hoping to provide much more content, with a steady cadence, and also add new cool twists to the core gameplay.",
        "New updates would also add new regions on the map. The regions of course introduce a lot of new levels - but also new troops, spells, tactics, items, bosses et cetera. Adding more varied content, and also gameplay twists, will create a lot of different permutations and challenges for players to defeat and master.",
        "Of course, Supercell has a high bar for any new release. We take the decision to launch a game or not very seriously! So first we want to develop the game to its full potential before making any decisions on a potential global launch.",

        "How everyone at Supercell, from new developers to CEO Ilkka Paananen, ensures the \"creative people are running the show\" at the studio behind Brawl Stars",
        "To celebrate the launch of Brawl Stars, Supercell paid for flight and lodging to bring GamesIndustry.biz to its headquarters in Helsinki, Finland for two days of interviews and discussions about the studio, its games, and its culture. This interview is the first in a multi-part series covering those discussions. You can also check out part two onSupercell's killed gamesand part three on itsrelationship with its game communities.",
        "When Supercell CEO Ilkka Paananenspoke at GDC last year, he told the crowd gathered that he referred to himself as \"the industry's least-powerful CEO.\" And it was with a similar speech that Paananen greeted nearly one hundred content creators at Supercell's Helsinki headquarters last month on the eve of the launch of the studio's fifth game, Brawl Stars.",
        "Paananen went on to tell both crowds what this meant for the power structure of one of the world's most successful development studios. Decision-making, he said, lay with the individual development teams as units and not at all with him. Paananen doesn't even give approval for decisions made by these teams, minor or major.",
        "\"What if we formed this new type of company where actually it would be the creative people running the show, and everybody else was there just to help?\"",
        "\"It's a very simple idea: what would happen if we turned this organization upside down?\" he asked. \"We wanted the creative people, the game developers, to have all the power. What if they would form this new type of company where actually it would be the creative people running the show, and everybody else was there just to help?\"",
        "Paananen's speech and \"least-powerful CEO\" title may sound idealistic and even unbelievable to those outside of Supercell. But over the course of two days of interviews with developers, game leads, community managers, and community members, I heard these same lines echoed again and again: the developers have all the power. They make the decisions. Those \"in charge\" at Supercell are simply there to remove obstacles.",
        "Take Frank Keienburg, game lead on Supercell's recent release Brawl Stars. As someone in charge of one of Supercell's game teams, he both reiterated Paananen's stance on what a \"leader\" at Supercell should be, but also acknowledged his place on a game team making decisions as a unit.",
        "\"As leads, we are not necessarily the people who say, 'We do this now,'\" Keienburg said. \"We are people who enable other people, and that can take very different forms. As a game lead, I enable the team to do their job. That can be, 'We don't have enough artists, I need to find more artists.' That can be, 'This guy's computer is too slow.' And it sounds funny, but in many companies around the world, people are sitting at a slow computer for half a year before something happens. I remove all the obstacles on the way and allow them to do their job.",
        "\"I'm also kind of the link to the outside world, so to speak. For our marketing efforts, for our partners, for everyone around it, so that the team can focus on what they love doing, which is the game. Game teams focus on the actual next thing we are doing, the next update, while I have the liberty to look further down the road. I look at the next 12 months so there is a vision of a direction we could take. After an update, we get together to discuss what we have lined up. And at a high level, if the team can't agree on doing something, then I would be the tie-breaker.\"",
        "Keienburg isn't alone. Clash of Clans game lead Eino Joas expressed a similar understanding of his role.",
        "\"I'm not someone who decides things,\" he said. \"I have opinions of where I think the problems are and what could be developed and made better, but I'm not the guy who makes calls. That's the team. I'm a facilitator of sorts in getting the team discussing things and forming team opinions. I've had some ideas that have been completely shut down.\"",
        "Joas was also one of many Supercell employees who had ended up in a lead position on a game somewhat by surprise, thanks to the company's relatively fluid structure for who works on what game. Multiple people told me that while no one at Supercell would simply jump ship from a pivotal role on a game team to do something elsewhere in the company, the studio allows tremendous freedom of movement to those who feel their interests and talents lay elsewhere. Often members of one team with some downtime will assist on other games where help is needed, and those temporary helping hands may find themselves eventually moving over entirely to the team they helped.",
        "\"I have opinions of where I think the problems are and what could be developed and made better, but I'm not the guy who makes calls\"",
        "\"I was previously doing game design on Boom Beach, then the previous lead got asked if he could help out a new game team going on at the time and he felt it was really important to do that,\" Joas said. \"We had been talking about it, but the timeline was way in the future, and then suddenly it just happened. There was a need, and people were like, 'Yeah, you'll do fine, just go for it.' And I was like, 'Well, I've only been on the team for a few months.' I didn't know the team well.\"",
        "Stefan Engblom told a similar story of fluid movement between teams, having worked on Hayday for two and a half years himself before ending up with the Clash Royale team. He and fellow Clash Royale developer Seth Allison said that while different teams across the studio may have unique processes for task tracking or communication within them, they all operate under the same fundamental idea of team-based decision-making and personal freedom to try new ideas.",
        "For example, Allison told me that during his first week on the Clash Royale team, he felt that something wasn't jiving with the game's progression system of giving cards to new players. But when he went to find someone to approve his idea to fix it, there was no one to give him permission.",
        "\"I kept looking for approval,\" he said. \"I kept going, 'Well, if I tell the game lead and he says it's okay then maybe it's okay,' and he was just like, 'Ah, do whatever, it's fine.' So I said, 'Well if I talk to 50% of the people on the team and they all say it's fine,' and I kept looking. 'What is the threshold for this is okay to do?' And the answer was, 'If you think it's the right thing to do, then do it, but also own it if it ends up being wrong.'",
        "\"Within the team, everybody comes with ideas,\" Engblom added. \"We discuss them, we think about, 'Is there something that is blatantly wrong with it?' But if it sounds cool and especially if it's something easy to test, then we usually just test it.\"",
        "Engblom, Allison, and many others were happy to celebrate the advantages that Supercell's structure had afforded them, but they did acknowledge that the format of team-focused decision making and independence came with its challenges.",
        "\"If you're the sort of employee that needs someone to have someone hand you a to-do list every day, then this is not a great environment,\" Allison said. \"You need to be very proactive. If you have downtime you need to be able to fill your own downtime with stuff that you think is very impactful and gets you moving. That can be a challenge for a lot of people, because there are definitely days when you're burnt out or tired and you're kinda like, 'Man, I wish someone would just tell me what to do today!' But long-term, you need all 20 members of the team to be very proactive in order to make it work. It doesn't work with people who are riding backseat. It creates a good confluence of opinions, everyone wants to chime in on what we're doing and that makes it a good, healthy environment.\"",
        "\"If you're the sort of employee that needs someone to have someone hand you a to-do list every day, then this is not a great environment\"",
        "\"Since every team is very independent, one flip side is that we tend to make similar mistakes,\" Engblom added. \"Communication is hard - we sort of focus on our own thing and we don't effectively [share] the knowledge. People might come to the same conclusions at the same time. We've become better at that, but that's kind of a thing.\"",
        "For a company of over 200 people, it was surprising to encounter what seemed to be fairly universal buy-in on such a unique structural idea. Paananen believes the mutual understanding stems from a continued emphasis on the company's culture from the beginning, and strong hiring to reinforce that culture.",
        "\"The only reason I think it works is that was the idea of the company from the very beginning,\" he said. \"There were six of us when we started, and we hired the next 15-20 people who we believe were aligned [with our values,] and they hired the next 20-30 people who were aligned, and those people hired more, and that's how it has grown. It's a big group of very, very like-minded people.",
        "\"We have this value of Supercell First, Team Second. It's not about me or any other leadership we have here. These people hold each other accountable, and we are more than 200 people now, a sort of critical mass. Culture isn't my responsibility or any single individual's responsibility. It's everyone's responsibility. And these people really care about culture and they look up to each other.\"",
        "He also echoed the sentiment expressed by Allison, that although the structure works well for Supercell, it requires people who enjoy \"creative freedom and risk-taking,\" and doesn't jive well with those who require process, structure, and oversight.",
        "He also acknowledged another challenge, one he himself personally experienced.",
        "\"It's always fun to talk about the structure when things are going well, on days like this,\" he said, referring to the launch of Brawl Stars. \"But it's a whole other thing to stick to the structure when things aren't going as well, or when you disagree with what some of the teams are doing. And then the question becomes, 'Do I still believe in the structure enough even if I'm not happy with how things are going? Do I still trust that the teams know what's best for Supercell?' You can disagree, but you commit. Ironically, the more successful we've become the harder that's become. That's something we talk about a lot, actually. I'm very proud that we've been able to hold onto this structure.\"",

        "Supercell team lead Timur Haussila says Clash Royale company creates hits by leaving control of projects up to the devs",
        "For most companies, succeeding in the mobile game market is like catching lightning in a bottle. It takes the right game at the right time with the right user acquisition strategy. It's hard enough to do properly once, much less repeatedly. But there are some companies that make it look at least a little bit easier. Supercell, for example, has released four games--Clash of Clans, Hay Day, Boom Beach, and Clash Royale--all of them hits.",
        "Supercell's Timur Haussila, lead developer on Hay Day and Boom Beach when those games launched, offered some insight into how the studio has managed to churn out nothing but successful games in his keynote address this morning at the Montreal International Games Summit. While one might expect a company with such a consistent track record to insist on a tightly controlled and predictable development methodology, Haussila said Supercell's approach is anything but.",
        "Before getting into Supercell's model, Haussila recapped a bit of the more traditional industry model, which he saw first hand when he began his career with Digital Chocolate's Helsinki studio as a product manager on Facebook games just seven years ago. Like many other companies, Digital Chocolate had teams of developers that answered to management that answered to more management and so on all the way up to the top of the company. There was a decision-making and greenlight process that took the big calls out of the hands of the game team and pushed them further up the management chain. Periodically, there would be product reviews where those same higher-ups would determine the fate of the game.",
        "\"It all starts from trust. If the team's working independently, it can't work without trust\"",
        "Haussila said the system worked to some extent, but it had issues. Before long, the goal became not to make the best game for the audience, but to get the product through the review process. It also led to a less innovative approach to game design that was ill-suited for a free-to-play world. When consumers have nearly unlimited choices before them, simply cloning the same style of game without any new angles didn't work as well as it might have in the more traditional console or PC industry.",
        "There were moments of respite, Haussila said, where he was on a small team without much oversight. But that was more a matter of nobody paying attention to what the team was doing rather than any great corporate revelation about developer autonomy. As soon as his project began returning promising results, the old controls came back in. Haussila was discouraged enough with this turn of events that he sought new opportunities, and wound up with Supercell.",
        "At Supercell, Haussila said the decision-making hierarchy is flipped with what he called a cell structure. Each team of developers is an autonomous cell, typically with no more than 15 people. The developers conceive game ideas and act on them, and the rest of the company exists to serve those teams, hiring the best people around them and taking care of logistical issues. Within each cell, Haussila said there is a lead, but responsibility is shared among the team. It can take some work to get the model working, but once things click, it begins to feed back into itself and create better results.",
        "\"It all starts from trust,\" Haussila said. \"If the team's working independently, it can't work without trust.\"",
        "That trust needs to be mutual, he added. The management needs to trust their developers to make great games, but the developers also need to trust the management to have their backs. If developers are afraid of failing because there will be consequences, then they won't take risks.",
        "It hasn't always gone smoothly, even for Supercell. After development of Hay Day and Clash of Clans, there were a number of teams and projects in a sort of limbo, where the projects had stagnated. They didn't want to kill the projects, but they were also worried about their projects living up to the success of the studio's first two titles. The company had created an atmosphere where the developers didn't trust the company enough to think failure was acceptable. To change that, Supercell set up a prototype team to give employees a safety net where they knew it was acceptable to try things out and throw them away if it wasn't coming together. That helped, but they still needed to make changes to ensure even developers on those prototype teams felt like their contributions were helpful.",
        "Part of that has to do with Supercell's greenlight process, which is a cycle starting from design to implementation to testing to analyzing. In the traditional model of game development, the analysis stage is conducted by management, which then makes the decision on whether to kill the project or keep it going. At Supercell, after analyzing the project, the developers take another crack at the design phase to see whether they have ideas to fix whatever might be wrong before killing it or greenlighting it through another round of the cycle.",
        "Again, this process runs on trust. With Clash Royale, Haussila said there was a point where almost nobody in the company believed in it. There were definite issues with it, but the game team still believed in it. It's hard sometimes to communicate the merits of what you're working on to the rest of the company, Haussila said, so it was crucial that Supercell placed enough trust in the team to continue on with development.",
        "\"If we deliver something to a global audience, I think we're also responsible to update it and maintain it for years to come\"",
        "At Supercell, Haussila said less is more. That extends not just to its catalog of released games, but to its headcount of under 100 people. More games and more people means more management and bureaucracy, he said. In turn, that means people have less ownership over their projects, less independence, and ultimately, less quality in the games that get made. Supercell doesn't even have an HR department in the usual sense, with those duties split between a recruitment staff and the various team leads.",
        "While the decision-making hierarchy is set up to support the individuals on each team, it only works at Supercell because the priorities guiding the decisions are made with an inverted focus. The top priority is always Supercell as a company. Given the company's focus on staying small, that can mean that resources and developers can be moved around to get behind a key title. That might rub people the wrong way if their project loses out in the process, but the well-being of the company has to come first. The next priority is to the teams, and then to individuals.",
        "Supercell also has a \"culture of killing,\" Haussila said. While the company launched four games, it has started on plenty more. There are tons of projects that start as prototypes, far less that become playable to the company, less that go into beta (only about 10% make it into company playables, Haussila said), and plenty of those never get a full release. Failure is tough to deal with, but the company wants to celebrate the things that were learned when projects are killed. That means when a game actually makes it through to launch, Supercell is utterly committed to it.",
        "\"If we deliver something to a global audience, I think we're also responsible to update it and maintain it for years to come,\" Haussila said.",
        "If Supercell's track record to date is anything to go by, the audience will be there to support those games for just as long.",

        "Success and sustainability at Supercell",
        "DLC: The Finnish studio's developers discuss how they keep games thriving for years, and CEO Ilkka Paananen shares his philosophy on crunch",
        "From time to time, there are interesting bits from our interviews that don't really fit well into the rest of the story, but are still worth reporting. Rather than relegate them to the trash bin of unpublished work, we'd like to repackage them into columns intended to provide additional insight on a variety of topics. These columns will be published under the banner of 'DLC'.",
        "All of the content from this particular DLC column comes from our visit to Supercell's Helsinki studios to celebrate the launch of Brawl Stars, for which Supercell paid the flight and lodging. In addition to these tidbits, you can also read partsone,two, andthreeof our series on the studio.",
        "Though I was at Supercell's studio for the launch of Brawl Stars, part of looking at where the new game might one day be headed involved speaking to the teams working on big hits such as Clash Royale. Now three years old, the game is still very popular and has managed to sustain an audience with far greater success than most mobile titles both due to its initial surge of popularity and a steady flow of updates.",
        "\"I feel like when you're chasing short-term goals, you can end up stepping on your own toes\"",
        "Developer Seth Allison told me that the team is now at a stage where it can start looking at how to tackle Clash Royale's next big update. And true to what I heard at other points during the week about Supercell's community focus, the process for determining what that will be involves looking at how the players were responding to what is already there.",
        "\"We try to approach it as a problem-solving mission,\" Allison said. \"What problems exist in the game? What challenges are players facing and how can we alleviate those problems or solve those challenges? A lot of times we talk about what the problem is, what's causing the problem, and if we want to fix the causes of the problem or create this other system that gives the players tools to combat that challenge. When we agree on a solution, we all work toward it together.\"",
        "It can be challenging to maintain a game's popularity over time, even with regular updates. Allison acknowledged that Clash Royale's numbers have dropped off somewhat over time, but that is natural for a game that's already a few years old. Allison said that it is less important to the team now to try to target business metrics such as revenue or player retention, and more important to focus on making a good game in the long-term.",
        "\"Having a long-term view for everything helps so much,\" he said. \"I feel like when you're chasing short-term goals, you can end up stepping on your own toes. But by always thinking, 'These games are going to be around for ten-plus years, so we're going to do this now, we're going to do this next year, we're going to do that the year after that,' that helps keep you from rushing too fast and burning yourself out.\"",
        "\"It's easy to say, 'We need a lot of fuel, so let's just cut down half the forest.' But then you find yourself going, 'Oh, man, we're out of trees'\"",
        "For Allison and his team that means, when it comes to decisions like those involved in the next update, sometimes the biggest and most exciting ideas don't end up being the best.",
        "\"Design space is like the environment. You have to manage: How many trees in the forest can you cut down? It's easy to be like, 'We need a lot of fuel right now, so let's just cut down half the forest.' But then you find yourself a year from then going, 'Oh, man, we're out of trees.'",
        "The thing that's nice about knowing you're going to be around for the better part of a decade or more -- Supercell's never closed a global game so theoretically these games are going to be around for 20 to 30 years -- is that you can be deliberate and intelligent about each step forward you want to make. You don't feel that pressure to, 'Oh my God, we have to rush out the next big thing.' That long-term view helps sustainability.\"",
        "I struck up a similar conversation with Clash of Clans team lead Eino Joas. Like the Clash Royale team, the Clash of Clans developers are challenged with keeping an older game sustainable in the long-term through regular updates. But Clash of Clans has been around for even longer, since 2012, and that makes it even more difficult to continue surprising players.",
        "\"We have millions and millions of players who love this game and would like to continue to play,\" Joas said. \"The challenge for us is to find ways to get them fired up and inspired about it year after year. I don't think we'll stop doing that. That's exactly the goal we want to achieve. It's going to be hard because we have to constantly reinvent, but also not reinvent because people want more of the same in a way, but you also have to offer them surprises.\"",
        "Another challenge Clash of Clans faces as an older game trying to remain relevant is that it's beginning to come up against its own popularity. Because of how big Clash of Clans was at its launch and ever since, it's becoming more and more difficult to attract totally new users.",
        "\"We still get a lot of organic traffic,\" Joas said. \"But it's more challenging for us to find players who haven't played Clash of Clans. Finding players who have never heard of and played the game but would be interested in it is getting increasingly hard. One thing we want to try out maybe next year is to inspire people who have once played the game to come back and try it again.",
        "\"Finding players who have never heard of and played Clash of Clans but would be interested in it is getting increasingly hard\"",
        "\"At the moment we think it's not a very easy experience to come back to and that's something we'd like to address, to make it easier and more fun to return to Clash of Clans.\"",
        "One thing that works in Supercell's favor for longevity across its portfolio, Joas told me, is that the company specializes in PvP titles. That means the players are constantly creating their own content, and updates come in the form of providing more ways to do that. Joas said that the studio is open to other types of games and progression systems, but it has to tread carefully if it wants to preserve its small team sizes and developer-led philosophy.",
        "\"Traditionally, we've been doing PvP games because it's a model that suits a small company,\" he said. \"We don't have armies of artists who could create content. If you take Fortnite, for example, it's a PvP game but progression is in skins, and every season you get the Battle Pass that offers you new and exciting stuff. Frankly, for us, that is a really difficult thing to pull off. Not to even talk about purely content-driven games where you add levels, for example, all the time.",
        "\"If we want to do those games, we have to be really smart about it. We are actively exploring those directions, but in the past it's basically been dictated by the fact that we have such small teams that we have been doing more PvP games where the content is actually other players and the competition between the players.\"",
        "One of the main topics of conversation while I was at Supercell was the studio's unusual, team-focused structure. CEO Ilkka Paananan has often referred to himself as the industry's \"least-powerful CEO,\" saying that his goal is to remove obstacles from the path of the teams at the company, and that, ideally, he would \"make zero decisions.\"",
        "For creative decision-making this seems to work quite well for Supercell, and the various teams I spoke to were universally on board with the idea. But outside of creative decision making, there are other important tasks that management ought take a leadership role in at any game development studio. A big one, especially coming out of the news cycle of 2018, is dealing with crunch.",
        "\"Crunch is one of the things that I don't think the games industry as a whole can be proud of\"",
        "\"Crunch is one of the things that I don't think the games industry as a whole can be proud of,\" Paananen said when I asked about his thoughts on the issue. \"Way too often, crunch is not an exception, it's a rule. It's almost like, you plan the game schedule with a crunch assumption. You have to get to crunch at some point, and sometimes that's very early on.",
        "\"But for us, of course the teams have goals, like when we'd like to get the game out. But ultimately they get the game out when they feel it's ready, so I like to believe we have way less crunch than most companies out there. And really, it's up to the team to decide. There is no one who can go and tell the team that they have to work much, much later hours. If you walk around this office at, say, 5:30 p.m. on a regular Wednesday, it probably would be quite empty.\"",
        "Despite the optimistic philosophy, Paananen did say that the decision to work later was up to the teams involved, and that there wasn't a particular system in place to encourage workers to take time away if self-inflicted crunch ever became a problem. In the end, accepting or avoiding crunch (just like the studio's team-first culture) is the responsibility of each individual and, to an extent, their team leads.",
        "\"Gaming is a creative business, and it's not about the hours you put in,\" Paananen said. \"Of course, sometimes you need to put in long hours, and the Brawl Stars team has been working super hard over the last two months. But that can't be the de facto way of working. Sometimes it can happen, but it can't be a rule. We're in a creative business and I just can't believe that people would come up with creative ideas if they're really, really tired or at risk of being burned out.",
        "\"Crunch is ultimately bad for the business in the long-term. We're trying to build a company that lasts for decades, and we can't do that if people get burned out. It's the wrong thing to do. It's wrong for the people's lives, their families, and everybody.\"",

        "For the last 18 months, Finnish game developer Supercell has been testing its next big thing. Last year, the developer behind mobile hits likeClash of ClansandClash Royalesoft-launched a new game calledBrawl Stars. It’s very different from anything the studio had done before. It’s a competitive shooter, for one thing, with a variety of modes that call to mind some of the biggest games on the market. There‘s battle royale, where players fight to the death, much as they do inFortnite, and team modes that require communication and coordination like inLeague of Legends. There is a range of quirky heroes, each with individual strengths, weaknesses, and colorful skins to unlock, just like inOverwatch.",
        "Not only isBrawl Starsa mashup of all of those experiences, but it’s also a game built specifically for mobile. No wonder it took so long to get right. “Every inch of it has been changed,” community manager Ryan Lighton says of the prolonged beta period.",
        "During the beta, the game was only available in a handful of countries. But today Supercell is announcing thatBrawl Stars’ long-gestating global launch is happening soon, on both iOS and Android, withpre-registration starting now. (Unfortunately, the developer doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but it’s expected to launch next month.) And while it may look like a mixture of existing games and genres, the studio says it’s the result of an organic, iterative development process.",
        "“Rather than saying we aimed to build a shooter for mobile,” explains Supercell CEO Ilkka Paananen, “it’s more accurate to say we set out to make a game unlike any other, and it evolved into a fast-paced, multiplayer, cartoony brawler.”",
        "I’ve been playing the game over the past week, and it’s a surprisingly seamless blend of all of those influences, but in a tight, streamlined package that fits comfortably on your phone. WhatClash Royaleis to complex strategy games,Brawl Starsis to competitive shooters. The main mode is a team-based battle where your squad needs to grab 10 gems, and then protect them before time runs out.Brawl Starstakes place from an overhead perspective, and it has a very loose, cartoony feel; if you step inside a bush you’ll disappear from view, and you attack by pulling back and firing like you had a slingshot.",
        "The combatants include a gunslinger with big sideburns, a sentient cactus, and a girl in a bear suit. Progression is similar toClash Royale: you earn coins and keys as you play, which provides loot boxes that can unlock new characters, as well as the ability to upgrade your current brawlers. There’s also a premium currency called gems that is primarily used for unlocking cosmetic skins.",
        "“We wanted to launch it very early.”",
        "You’ll also open up new modes the more you play, including battle royale. As you’d expect, things are scaled back quite a bit in that mode compared to the likes ofPUBGorFortnite. Instead of fighting off against 100 other players, each arena is filled with 10 fighters, and the last person standing wins. There’s lots of cover to hide behind, and, yes, a poisonous cloud steadily closes in, shrinking the battlefield. The most surprising thing aboutBrawl Starsis how good it feels; mobile shooters are notoriously frustrating due to the inaccuracy of touchscreens.Brawl Starsisn’t perfect, but somehow I never found myself fighting with the controls.",
        "The game wasn’t always so smooth. Development onBrawl Starsbegan around four years ago, and according to Jon Franzas, a designer and programmer who initially served as the project lead, it changed a lot over that time. When the game first hit soft launch, for instance, it was played in portrait mode and used a control scheme where you tapped the screen to move your character around. But once people started playing, the developers realized that movement wasn’t working. Most players wanted to use a virtual joystick, which was difficult to implement in portrait mode due to the limited screen space.",
        "Soon, after switching up the controls, the developers settled on playing in landscape, though Franzas says there were plenty of other changes after that, including multiple ground-up revisions of the user interface. That’s part of the reasonBrawl Starswas in beta so early. “As a company we don’t have so much experience with this type of game,” Franzas explains. “So we wanted to launch it very early, in a very raw and unfinished state.”",
        "2018 is turning into the year of battle royale games, with even the biggest franchises around, likeCall of DutyandBattlefield, jumping on the trend that’s so closely associated withFortnite. According to Franzas, though,Brawl Starsisn’t exactly an imitator, despite coming out so long after its competitors. “The very first version was actually more of a battle royale, where you play alone,” he says. “That was before battle royale was a big thing yet.” As the game progressed, it evolved into more of a team-based experience — Franzas is a big fan ofLeague of Legends, and wanted to do something similar on mobile — and eventually the studio decided to offer both styles of play.",
        "Those large-scale changes also apply to the way the game looks. InitiallyBrawl Starshad a sci-fi style, with astronauts and aliens, which slowly morphed into more of a Western look to better fit the style of game. Characters like Colt and Bull are typical gunslingers, with big guns and bigger hair, but from there things get strange, and move well beyond the Wild West. “That was just our jumping off point,” says artist Paul Chambers. “We never intended to stay there.” Later characters you can unlock include a toxic crow in a leather jacket, a tarot card-wielding fighter, a robotic pirate shaped like a barrel, and an engineer with a cute gun turret.",
        "“It’s not a violent thing.”",
        "Theme aside,Brawl Starsalso has a very different look compared to past Supercell games. The likes ofClash RoyaleorBoom Beachhave a style reminiscent of a CG movie, whereasBrawl Starsis cleaner and simpler. “Maybe before we had a Pixar style, but this time we were aiming for Cartoon Network,” Chambers explains. In order to keep the game approachable for a wide audience, the art team also wanted to deemphasize the gun aspect of the experience.Brawl Starsis a shooter, but it’s not especially violent. There are no blood or death animations. In fact, some of the characters don’t have guns at all, like the luchador with a punch so big it’s almost like a shotgun blast. “We’re avoiding the violence as much as we can,” says Chambers. “It’s like a Nerf gun. It’s not a violent thing.”",
        "Like most Supercell games,Brawl Starswas built by a relatively small team. There are around 13 developers working on the game, not including support staff like the community team, though that number fluctuates at times. With the global launch looming, for instance, the group will need all hands on deck. As part of that shift, Franzas, who has been leading the project, is stepping back to a more design-focused role. Frank Keienburg, who has more experience at Supercell with customer support and marketing, has taken over.",
        "It may sound like a demotion, but it’s actually in keeping with Supercell’s structural philosophy, which — similar to game studios like Valve — emphasizes a flatter organizational chart, without managers.. The idea is to keep people focused on what they’re good at. For Franzas, that means developingBrawl Stars, and not dealing with all of the additional complications that come from a big, global release. “It’s a matter of thinking about what makes sense for the game,” he says. “I want the game to succeed and be as great as possible.”",
        "WhenBrawl Starsdoes come out, it’ll have a lot of pressure. Currently, Supercell only operates four other games; it kills off titles in beta if they don’t catch on with players, focusing its energy on the more likely hits. After so long in development,Brawl Starsis primed to join that elusive club, but with a completely different style of game that has the potential to reach a whole new audience. And Paananen has high hopes. “This is a huge moment for us.”",

        "Running a farm is hard and often thankless workâunless that farm happens to be an adorable piece of virtual land overseen by a helpful, chatty scarecrow. Swiping across plots of land to harvest crops, feed livestock and manufacture goods is pleasantly relaxing, and growing your tiny farm into a booming business is a hugely satisfying achievement. Silly characters, cute critters and a variety of things to plant, reap, build and sell make Hay Day easy to pick up and tough to put down.",
        "Iâve been playing this game for over 5 years and even if I donât play consistently, I always find my way back. (Iâm Level 46) This game reminds me so much of the OG Facebook FarmVille game and I love it. Btw the crops do not wither away on this game! ;) this is not a pay to win game in my opinion, Iâve spend maybe $50 in diamonds in all my years of playing just because I wanted to, not because I had to to advance levels. Of course most of the decorations/houses/trucks that you can buy to make your farm look unique are for diamonds but itâs not necessary. I havenât noticed many glitches when Iâm playing, so I think the dev team is pretty quick at fixing issues. One complaint I have is I wish it was easier to be able to expand my farm. You have to collect SO many different items to get more space. ð«  and that getting the colored tickets was a bit easier. All the extra animals like cats, dogs, and horses all cost a certain amount of tickets to get them roaming around on your farm. Iâd also mention that I donât like how the storage is set up, like I have so many different decorations/fencing that itâs hard to see what I have because you have to go through the store tab. Not big complaints but they do bug me.But overall, this game is fun, once your high enough level it will keep you very busy!",
        "I have enjoyed this game for years.  The obvious greed of the developers in the last several months is the reason I am reducing my rating.  They are withholding previous deals to purchase the diamonds necessary to play at a high level, where hiring Tom and being able to speed up tasks require diamonds.  They added a $4.99 per month feature that gives good benefit, but adds $60 to my annual expense.  I used to be able to spend $70 to purchase 4000 diamonds twice a year, bringing my annual cost to $200.  Now, I am not seeing the $70 offer.In the Valley, they are making it impossible to complete all the tasks by not having needed resources available without paying diamonds to allow more movement.  I settle for not finishing all tasks everyday.  This session, my team may not make the requirements to gain benefits at the end due to lack of âchickensâ to capture.  An Easter production feature that is short-lived would require 20 plus diamonds to be more useful.  There are increasingly frequent offers that would take more money now.  All very off-putting and making me think of leaving the game.Benefits of the game for me are the social interaction with teammates, interesting challenges to manage production and resources to maximize  outcomes, and the beautiful graphics.  I am 82 years old and able to play off and on during the day which makes achieving goals doable.  I believe the mental effort I must expend keeps my mind sharp.  I am a CoLeader on my team.",
